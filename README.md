# PSSM
__Phase Shift Songs Manager__ is meant to be a simple, yet powerfull manager for Phase Shift songs allowing numer of operations to be taken upon those songs.  
  
## TODO list:
* ~~double click on song will launch it in Phase Shift (either in normal or in practice mode) [will be official v0.1 after beta testing this]~~,
* __song.ini__ tags editor (for both individual songs and whole collections),
* simple audio player based on FMOD,
* _Kamikaze mode_ - extremly fast launch of the song by modifying game settings "_just in time_",
* profile and game settings editors,
* easy to use career editor,
* key bindings editor.
  
## Songs  
Songs in Phase Shift are organized identically as in FoF/FoFiX - single folder containing all files required to play it in-game.  
  
Typically such folder contains:  
* __song.ini__ - INI file containing basic info about song, like artist, title, album etc.,
* __guitar.ogg__ - required audio file (for guitar mode) in OGG Vorbis format,
* __notes.mid__ - file describing placement and time of each fret for each instrument.  
  
Of course this is only the minimum required to play songs. More files can be put into the folder, e.g. for drums, rhytm, vocals, background sound, choir etc.
